Claude.MD rules:
Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
8. ALWAYS end each response with the current server URL so the user can easily click on it to test the system.

## IMPORTANT REMINDER
üñ•Ô∏è ALWAYS SHOW SERVER URL: End every response with the current server URL so the user can easily access the system.

### üîß TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Enhanced conversion system handles both legacy and resident tool formats automatically
- All 25 cases use professional NCS/EMG chart format with standard studies
- System detects resident tool format via `ncsStudies` array with `type`, `nerve`, `interpretation` fields
- `convertResidentToolToProfessionalFormat()` function ready for future case additions
