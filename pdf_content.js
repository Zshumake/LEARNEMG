Anatomy for Needle 
Electromyography
UPPER EXTREMITY
MEDIAN NERVE
Abductor Pollicis Brevis (APB) (Figure 13–1A,B)
Innervation:
Median nerve, medial cord, lower trunk, C8–T1
Needle Insertion:
Insert needle tangentially into the lateral thenar 
eminence, just lateral to mid-point of ﬁrst  
metacarpal
Activation:
Abduct the thumb with arm and hand in the supinated 
position
Key Clinical Points:
• The APB is the best median muscle to sample distal 
to the carpal tunnel.
• May be abnormal in carpal tunnel syndrome, proximal 
median neuropathies, lower trunk/medial cord 
plexopathy, thoracic outlet syndrome, C8–T1 radicu-
lopathy, and distal polyneuropathy.
• Spared in anterior interosseous nerve syndrome.
• The APB often is perceived as more painful to sample 
than other intrinsic hand muscles.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is inserted too medially, it may be in the 
ﬂexor pollicis brevis, which has both median and ulnar 
innervation.
• If the needle is inserted too deeply, it may be in the 
opponens pollicis, also innervated by the median 
nerve.

Opponens Pollicis (OP) (Figure 13–2A,B)
Innervation:
Median nerve, medial cord, lower trunk, C8–T1
Needle Insertion:
With the needle parallel to the hand, insert needle into 
the patient’s lateral thenar eminence, just above the 
ﬁrst metacarpal bone

Have the patient oppose the thumb to little ﬁnger with 
the arm and hand in the supinated position
Key Clinical Points:
• May be abnormal in carpal tunnel syndrome, proximal 
median neuropathies, lower trunk/medial cord 
plexopathy, thoracic outlet syndrome, C8–T1 radicu-
lopathy, distal polyneuropathy.
• Spared in anterior interosseous nerve syndrome.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• The OP muscle lies below the APB. If the needle is 
inserted too medially or superﬁcially, it will be in the 
APB.

Flexor Pollicis Longus (FPL)  
(Figure 13–5A,B)
Innervation:
Anterior interosseous nerve, median nerve, lateral–medial 
cords, middle–lower trunks, C7–C8–T1
Needle Insertion:
With the patient’s forearm supinated, insert the needle 
straight down one-third the distance up from the 
lateral wrist toward the lateral elbow, over the radius
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the thumb at the interphalangeal 
joint
Key Clinical Points:
• Often abnormal in anterior interosseous nerve 
syndrome or proximal median neuropathies.
• The FPL is a distal C8 median-innervated muscle 
above the wrist.
• Spared in carpal tunnel syndrome.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: the radial artery is just lateral to the inser -
tion point.
• Caution: the superﬁcial radial sensory nerve is lateral 
to the insertion point.
• If the needle is too superﬁcial, it may be in the ﬂexor 
digitorum sublimis.
Flexor Pollicis Brevis (FPB) (Figure 13–3A,B)
Innervation:
Median and ulnar nerves, medial cord, lower trunk, 
C8–T1
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle just medial to mid-point of the ﬁrst 
metacarpal in the thenar eminence
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the thumb at the metacarpal–
phalangeal joint
Key Clinical Points:
• Sampling this muscle is often perceived as more 
painful than the APB.
• The superﬁcial head usually is median innervated; the 
deep head usually is ulnar innervated.
• Innervation varies widely in normal subjects. In some 
individuals, both heads are median innervated; in 
others, both are ulnar.
• Because of normal anatomic variation, abnormalities 
should be interpreted with caution when trying to 
separate median from ulnar lesions.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is inserted too laterally, it will be in the 
abductor pollicis brevis.
Pronator Quadratus (PQ) (Figure 13–4A,B)
Innervation:
Anterior interosseous nerve, median nerve, lateral–medial 
cords, middle–lower trunks, C7–C8–T1

With the patient’s hand in mid-position between 
supination and pronation, insert the needle in the 
patient’s dorsal forearm three ﬁngerbreadths proximal 
to the mid-point of a line drawn from the ulnar to 
radial styloids. Insert the needle deep through the 
interosseous membrane
Activation:
Have the patient pronate the hand with the elbow ﬂexed
Key Clinical Points:
• May be abnormal in anterior interosseous nerve 
syndrome or proximal median neuropathies.
• The PQ is a distal C8 median-innervated muscle 
above the wrist.
• Spared in carpal tunnel syndrome.
• The muscle is deep to the ﬁnger and thumb extensor 
muscles and their tendons.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Before reaching the muscle, one must go through the 
thick interosseous membrane.

Flexor Digitorum Profundus to Digits 2, 3 
(FDP 2, 3) (Figure 13–6A,B)
Innervation:
Anterior interosseous nerve, median nerve, medial cord, 
lower trunk, C7–C8–T1
Needle Insertion:
With the patient’s elbow ﬂexed, hand pointing toward 
the head and the back of the hand facing down, insert 
the needle three to four ﬁngerbreadths distal to the 
olecranon
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the ﬁngers (digit 2 or digit 3) at the 
distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints
Key Clinical Points:
• Deeper layers are median-innervated (anterior 
interosseous nerve) to digits 2 and 3.
• Superﬁcial layers are ulnar-innervated to digits 4  
and 5.
• Median slips (deep) are difﬁcult to study. The 
individual muscle slip can be identiﬁed by having the 
patient ﬂex one ﬁnger at a time.
• The median FDP may be abnormal in anterior 
interosseous nerve syndrome or proximal median 
neuropathies.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: when placing the needle this deep, the main 
ulnar nerve is within reach of the needle. T o avoid the 
ulnar nerve, the needle should be angled medially 
toward the body. Indeed, this muscle is best avoided 
unless it is needed to establish the diagnosis (e.g., 
anterior interosseous neuropathy).
Flexor Digitorum Sublimis (FDS)  
(Figure 13–7A,B)
Innervation:
Median nerve, medial–lateral cords, middle–lower trunks, 
C7–C8
Needle Insertion:
With the patient’s forearm supinated, insert the needle 
just medial to the mid-point between the biceps 
tendon and the mid-wrist
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the digits at the proximal 
interphalangeal (PIP) joints
Key Clinical Points:
• May be abnormal in proximal median  
neuropathies.
• Spared in anterior interosseous nerve syndrome.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• The FDS supplies digits 2–5. The slips to different 
ﬁngers can be determined by placing the needle 
slightly lateral or medial to the original location, and 
having the patient move individual ﬁngers.
• If the needle is too deep, it will be in the FDP .
• Caution: if the needle is placed in the midline and too 
deeply, it may reach the median nerve.
• More difﬁcult muscle to localize than other proximal 
median muscles (e.g., FCR and PT).

Key Clinical Points:
• Often abnormal in C6 or C7 radiculopathy.
• Often abnormal in proximal median neuropathies 
including pronator syndrome.
• Spared in anterior interosseous nerve syndrome.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is too medial, it may be in the FDS.
• If the needle is too lateral and deep, it may be in the 
PT .
• Caution: if the needle is placed too deeply, it may 
reach the median nerve.

Innervation:
Ulnar nerve, medial cord, lower trunk, C8–T1
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle into the medial hand at the mid-point 
of the ﬁfth metacarpal
Activation:
Have the patient abduct the little ﬁnger (spread the 
ﬁngers)

Guyon’s canal. May be abnormal in ulnar neuropathy, 
lower trunk/medial cord plexopathy, thoracic outlet 
syndrome, C8–T1 radiculopathy, distal 
polyneuropathy.
• This muscle often is perceived as more painful than 
the FDI.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is inserted too deeply, it will be in the 
ﬂexor or opponens digiti minimi; however, both of 
these muscles are also supplied by the ulnar nerve in 
the hypothenar eminence.

ﬁngers)
Key Clinical Points:
• The FDI is easy to study.
• It is the least painful of the intrinsic hand muscles.
• Often abnormal in ulnar lesions at Guyon’s canal. 
May be abnormal in ulnar neuropathy, lower trunk/
medial cord plexopathy, thoracic outlet syndrome, 
C8–T1 radiculopathy, distal polyneuropathy.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:

With the patient’s forearm supinated, insert the needle 
into the medial forearm at the mid-point between the 
elbow and wrist
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the wrist in ulnar deviation or 
abduct the ﬁfth ﬁnger
Key Clinical Points:
• T o ensure the proper needle location, ask the patient 
to spread his or her ﬁngers. During ﬁfth-ﬁnger 
abduction, the FCU contracts to ﬁx the pisiform 
bone, the origin of the ADM.
• The FCU muscle is very superﬁcial and thin.
• The muscle often is spared in ulnar neuropathy at the 
elbow, especially in mild cases.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is inserted too deeply, it will be in the 
FDP .
Flexor Digitorum Profundus to Digits 4, 5 
(FDP 4, 5) (Figure 13–12A,B)
Innervation:
Ulnar nerve, medial cord, lower trunk, C7– C8–T1
Needle Insertion:
With the patient’s elbow ﬂexed, hand pointing toward 
the head and the back of the hand facing down, insert 
the needle three to four ﬁngerbreadths distal to the 
olecranon
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the ﬁngers at the DIP joints
Key Clinical Points:
• Superﬁcial layers are ulnar-innervated to digits 4  
and 5.
• Deeper layers are median-innervated (anterior 
interosseous nerve) to digits 2 and 3.
• Ulnar slips (superﬁcial) are easy to study. The 
individual muscle slip can be identiﬁed by having the 
patient ﬂex one ﬁnger at a time.
• The ulnar FDP often is involved in ulnar neuropathy 
at the elbow.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: the main ulnar nerve is within reach of the 
needle. T o avoid the ulnar nerve, the needle should be 
angled slightly medially toward the body.

thy and C5 or C6 radiculopathy.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• As long as this muscle is sampled from the anterior 
approach, there are no other nearby vascular struc -
tures or major nerves.
• If this muscle is sampled from the medial side  
(which is not recommended), the brachial artery,  
the median nerve and other large veins would be 
vulnerable to injury.

radiculopathy.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is too medial, it will be in the 
infraspinatus.
• If the needle is too superﬁcial and/or too lateral, it 
will be in the posterior head of the deltoid.

Activation:
Have the patient turn his or her head and neck to the 
contralateral side
Key Clinical Points:
• The sternocleidomastoid often is involved in spas -
modic torticollis.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: The needle must remain superﬁcial at all 
times to avoid injury to the carotid artery or jugular 
vein.

SUPRASCAPULAR NERVE
Supraspinatus (SS) (Figure 13–27A,B)
Innervation:
Suprascapular nerve, upper trunk, C5–C6
Needle Insertion:
With the patient lying on his or her side, the shoulder to 
be studied placed upward, and the elbow at the side, 
insert the needle just rostral and medial to the mid-
point of the scapular spine
Activation:
Have the patient abduct the shoulder
Key Clinical Points:
• If the needle is inserted too superﬁcially, it will be in 
the trapezius.
• The SS may be spared in suprascapular neuropathy at 
the spinoglenoid notch.
• The muscle is more difﬁcult to study than the 
infraspinatus.
• It may be abnormal in upper trunk plexopathy and 
C5–C6 radiculopathy.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is too superﬁcial, it will be in the upper 
trapezius.
• Caution: Rare cases of pneumothorax have been 
reported with improper needle placement too rostral 
and deep.
Infraspinatus (IS) (Figure 13–28A,B)
Innervation:
Suprascapular nerve, upper trunk, C5–C6
Needle Insertion:
With the patient lying on his or her side, shoulder to be 
studied placed upward, and the elbow at the side, 
insert the needle one to two ﬁngerbreadths below the 
mid-point of the scapular spine
Activation:
Have the patient externally rotate the shoulder
Key Clinical Points:
• Often abnormal in suprascapular neuropathy, upper 
trunk plexopathy, and C5 or C6 radiculopathy.
• The scapula (infrascapular fossa) is deep to the 
muscle (thus, there is no risk of pneumothorax if the 
needle is correctly placed).
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Much of the muscle is superﬁcial. However, if the 
needle is inserted too superﬁcially near the scapular 
spine, it may be in the posterior deltoid. Hence, if  
the needle is inserted down to the scapula, then 
withdrawn slightly, one can be assured that the needle 
is in the correct muscle.

LONG THORACIC NERVE
Serratus Anterior (SA) (Figure 13–31A,B)
Innervation:
Long thoracic nerve, C5–C6–C7
Needle Insertion:
With the patient lying on his or her side and the shoulder 
to be studied placed upward, carefully insert the needle 
over the sixth rib at the mid-axillary line
Activation:
Have the patient push his or her hand forward with the 
arm straight
Key Clinical Points:
• Because the long thoracic nerve arises proximal to the 
brachial plexus, the serratus anterior is spared in 
brachial plexopathy.
• Often abnormal in “brachial plexitis” (also known as 
brachial amyotrophy or more properly, neuralgic 
amyotrophy).
• The SA muscle is difﬁcult to study because most of 
the muscle lies between the rib cage and scapula.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Use caution with needle insertion. If the needle is 
inserted between the ribs, there is a risk of neurovas -
cular bundle injury or pneumothorax.
DORSAL SCAPULAR NERVE
Rhomboids (Figure 13–29A,B)
Innervation:
Dorsal scapular nerve, C4–C5
Needle Insertion:
With the patient lying on his or her side, the side to be 
studied placed upward, and the arm internally rotated 
and ﬂexed at the elbow with the dorsum of the  
hand on the midback, insert needle at the mid-point 
between the medial border of the scapula and midback
Activation:
Raise hand from the back
Key Clinical Points:
• May be abnormal in C5 radiculopathy.
• Because the dorsal scapular nerve arises proximal to 
the brachial plexus, the rhomboids are spared in 
upper trunk brachial plexopathy.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is inserted too superﬁcially, it will be in 
the trapezius.
• If the needle is inserted too deeply, it will be in the 
paraspinal muscles.
• Caution: Rare cases of pneumothorax have been 
reported with improper needle placement too deep.
THORACODORSAL NERVE
Latissimus Dorsi (LD) (Figure 13–30A,B)
Innervation:
Thoracodorsal nerve, posterior cord, upper–middle–lower 
trunks, C6–C7–C8
Needle Insertion:
With the patient lying on his or her side and the side to 
be studied placed upward, insert the needle lateral to 
the tip of the scapula at the posterior axillary line
Activation:
With the patient’s shoulder internally rotated and 
adducted, and the arm above the horizontal, have the 
patient extend the shoulder (i.e., bring the hand down 
toward the foot)
Key Clinical Points:
• The LD is more difﬁcult to study than the triceps and 
other radial-innervated muscles that have similar cord, 
trunk, and root innervation.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is too deep, it may be in the serratus 
anterior.

Have the patient extend the toes
Key Clinical Points:
• May be involved in anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome.
• Use caution with the interpretation of abnormalities. 
Some denervation and reinnervation is common in 
normal subjects without symptoms. Side-to-side 
comparison can be useful.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Muscle is extremely superﬁcial and very thin.
• T endons from the EDL run over the muscle
Extensor Hallucis Longus (EHL)  
(Figure 13–33A,B)
Innervation:
Deep peroneal nerve, common peroneal nerve, sciatic 
nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L4–L5–S1

Key Clinical Points:
• The EHL is a strongly L5-innervated distal muscle.
• The muscle often is perceived as painful; several 
tendons are close by.
• It often is abnormal in lesions of the deep or common 
peroneal nerves.
• The EHL is one of the most distal muscles in the leg 
and often is abnormal in polyneuropathy.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Note that the EHL is just lateral to the TA tendon.
• If the needle is inserted too deep, it could come close 
to the deep peroneal nerve and nearby vascular 
structures.
• As the needle is inserted, it may be perceived as 
painful if it passes near or through nearby tendons.
Extensor Digitorum Longus (EDL)  
(Figure 13–34A,B)
Innervation:
Deep peroneal nerve, common peroneal nerve, sciatic 
nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L4–L5
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle three to four ﬁngerbreadths lateral to 
the tibial crest, between the tibialis anterior and 
peroneus longus muscles
Activation:
Have the patient extend the toes
Key Clinical Points:
• The EDL is more difﬁcult to locate than the tibialis 
anterior muscle.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is too medial, it will be in the TA.
• If the needle is too lateral, it will be in the PL.

Peroneus Longus (PL) (Figure 13–36A,B)
Innervation:
Superﬁcial peroneal nerve, common peroneal nerve, 
sciatic nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L5–S1
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle into the lateral calf, three to four 
ﬁngerbreadths distal to the ﬁbular head
Activation:
Have the patient evert the ankle
Key Clinical Points:
• The PL is the most accessible muscle innervated by 
the superﬁcial peroneal nerve.
• Often abnormal in lesions of the superﬁcial or 
common peroneal nerves.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is too anterior, it will be in the EHL.
• If the needle is too posterior, it will be in the soleus.
• Caution: if the needle is placed too deeply, the deep 
peroneal nerve is vulnerable to injury.
Tibialis Anterior (TA) (Figure 13–35A,B)
Innervation:
Deep peroneal nerve, common peroneal nerve, sciatic 
nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L4–L5
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle just lateral to the tibial crest, two thirds 
the distance up from the ankle toward the knee
Activation:
Have the patient dorsiﬂex the ankle
Key Clinical Points:
• Often abnormal in L4 or L5 radiculopathy and lesions 
of the deep or common peroneal nerves.
• The TA is the simplest to localize and activate, of the 
deep peroneal nerve innervated muscles.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• As long as this muscle is sampled from the anterior 
lateral approach, there are no other nearby vascular 
structures or major nerves.

Insert the needle tangentially into the medial foot at the 
mid-point between the heel and the ball of the foot
Activation:
Have the patient spread the toes
Key Clinical Points:
• The AHB often is difﬁcult to activate.
• The muscle often is perceived as painful.
• May be abnormal in tarsal tunnel syndrome.
• Use caution with the interpretation of abnormalities. 
Some denervation and reinnervation is common in 
normal subjects without symptoms. Side-to-side 
comparison can be useful.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• The muscle is very superﬁcial.
• If the needle is placed too deeply, the medial plantar 
nerve is vulnerable to injury.
Flexor Hallucis Brevis (FHB) (Figure 13–38A,B)
Innervation:
Medial plantar nerve, tibial nerve, sciatic nerve, 
lumbosacral plexus, S1–S2
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle into the medial sole, just below the ball 
of the foot, medial to the tendon of the ﬂexor hallucis 
longus (FHL)
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the great toe
Key Clinical Points:
• The FHB often is difﬁcult to activate.
• It often is perceived as painful.
• May be abnormal in tarsal tunnel syndrome.
• It is not recommended to sample this muscle in 
patients with peripheral vascular insufﬁciency, 
especially associated with diabetes.
• Use caution with the interpretation of abnormalities. 
Some denervation and reinnervation is common in 
normal subjects without symptoms. Side-to-side 
comparison can be useful.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is too medial, it will be in the AHB.
• Note how the tendon of the FHL runs superﬁcial to 
the muscle.
Abductor Digiti Quinti Pedis (ADQP)  
(Figure 13–39A,B)
Innervation:
Lateral plantar nerve, tibial nerve, sciatic nerve, 
lumbosacral plexus, S1–S2
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle tangentially into the lateral foot two to 
three ﬁngerbreadths proximal to the ﬁfth metatarsal–
phalangeal joint
Activation:
Have the patient spread the toes
Key Clinical Points:
• The ADQP often is difﬁcult to activate.
• It often is perceived as painful.
• May be abnormal in tarsal tunnel syndrome.
• Use caution with the interpretation of abnormalities. 
Some denervation and reinnervation is common in 
normal subjects without symptoms. Side-to-side 
comparison can be useful.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Note that the muscle is very superﬁcial.
• Note that the tendon to the PL is just anterior.

Soleus (SOL) (Figure 13–41A,B)
Innervation:
Tibial nerve, sciatic nerve, lumbosacral plexus, S1–S2
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle medial to the tibia, slightly distal to the 
mid-point between the ankle and knee
Activation:
Have the patient plantar ﬂex the ankle
Key Clinical Points:
• The SOL is difﬁcult to activate.
• It is a distal S1-innervated muscle.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is inserted with the needle pointing too 
anteriorly toward the tibia, it will be in the ﬂexor 
digitorum longus.
Gastrocnemius–Medial Head (MG)  
(Figure 13–40A,B)
Innervation:
Tibial nerve, sciatic nerve, lumbosacral plexus, S1–S2
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle into the rostral, medial posterior calf
Activation:
Have the patient plantar ﬂex the ankle
Key Clinical Points:
• The MG often is difﬁcult to activate. In some 
patients, activation can be more easily accomplished 
by ﬂexing the knee ﬁrst, and then having the patient 
plantar ﬂex the ankle.
• It is a distal S1-innervated muscle and often is 
abnormal in S1 radiculopathy.
• For the assessment of S1 involvement, the MG is 
preferred over the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) as L5 
does not innervate the MG, whereas some L5 ﬁbers 
may be present in the LG.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is too deep, it will be in the soleus. 
However, the soleus is supplied by the same nerve 
(tibial) and same myotomes ( S1–S2).

Tibialis Posterior (TP) (Figure 13–42A,B)
Innervation:
Tibial nerve, sciatic nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L5–S1
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle medial to the tibia, slightly distal to the 
mid-point between the ankle and knee, deep to the 
ﬂexor digitorum longus
Activation:
Have the patient invert the ankle
Key Clinical Points:
• The TP is a predominantly L5-innervated tibial 
muscle.
• Extremely useful in the evaluation of foot drop in 
differentiating peroneal neuropathy from sciatic nerve 
lesion, lumbosacral plexopathy, or L5 radiculopathy.
• A deep muscle, the TP often requires a longer needle 
(37 mm).
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is inserted too superﬁcially, it will be in 
the ﬂexor digitorum longus.
• Caution: if the needle is inserted pointing too 
posterior, the tibial nerve and nearby vascular struc -
tures are vulnerable to injury.
Flexor Digitorum Longus (FDL)  
(Figure 13–43A,B)
Innervation:
Tibial nerve, sciatic nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L5–S1
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle medial to the tibia, slightly distal to the 
mid-point between the ankle and knee, deep to the 
soleus
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the toes
Key Clinical Points:
• The FDL is a predominantly L5-innervated muscle.
• Useful in the evaluation of foot drop in differentiating 
peroneal neuropathy from sciatic nerve lesion, 
lumbosacral plexopathy, or L5 radiculopathy.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: the saphenous nerve is just anterior to the 
needle insertion site.
• Caution: if the needle is inserted at the correct 
location but directed too posteriorly, the tibial nerve 
and nearby vascular structures are vulnerable to injury.
• If the needle is inserted too posteriorly, or directed 
posteriorly, it will be in the soleus.
• If the needle is too deep, it will be in the tibialis 
posterior.

Biceps Femoris–Long Head (BF–LH)  
(Figure 13–45A,B)
Innervation:
Sciatic nerve (tibial division), lumbosacral plexus, L5– S1
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle at the mid-point between the lateral 
knee and the ischial tuberosity
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the knee
Key Clinical Points:
• The BF–LH may be abnormal in sciatic nerve lesions, 
lumbosacral plexopathy, or S1 radiculopathy. In 
general the lateral hamstrings are predominantly S1 
whereas the medial hamstrings are L5.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• At this location more proximal in the thigh, only the 
long head of the biceps femoris is present on needle 
EMG in the lateral posterior thigh (the short head is 
more distal in the thigh).
• If the needle is too posterior, it will be in the 
semitendinosus.
SCIATIC NERVE (NOTE THAT ALL 
PERONEAL- AND TIBIAL-
INNERVATED MUSCLES ALSO ARE 
SCIATIC INNERVATED)
Biceps Femoris–Short Head (BF–SH)  
(Figure 13–44A,B)
Innervation:
Sciatic nerve (peroneal division), lumbosacral plexus, 
L5–S1
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle three to four ﬁngerbreadths proximal to 
the lateral knee, medial to the tendon to the long head 
of the biceps femoris
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the knee
Key Clinical Points:
• The BF–SH is the only muscle innervated by the 
peroneal division of the sciatic nerve above the ﬁbular 
neck.
• Important to check in suspected lesions of the 
peroneal nerve at the ﬁbular neck. In peroneal lesions 
at the ﬁbular neck, it will be normal. In sciatic lesions 
or higher that mimic clinically a peroneal neuropathy 
at the ﬁbular neck, this muscle may be abnormal.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: if the needle is directly too medially and too 
deep, the sciatic nerve is vulnerable to injury. The 
muscle is very superﬁcial.
• The muscle can also be sampled by inserting the 
needle anterior to the tendon of the long head of the 
biceps femoris – however, there the needle must be 
directed downward.

Semimembranosus (SM) (Figure 13–46A,B)
Innervation:
Sciatic nerve (tibial division), lumbosacral plexus, 
L4–L5–S1
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle three to four ﬁngerbreadths proximal to 
the medial knee, lateral to the tendon of the 
semitendinosus
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the knee
Key Clinical Points:
• May be abnormal in sciatic nerve lesions, lumbosacral 
plexopathy, or L5 radiculopathy. In general, the 
medial hamstrings are predominantly L5 whereas the 
lateral hamstrings are S1.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Although the SM can be sampled along the entire 
medial thigh, at this location distal in the thigh, only 
the SM is present. The semitendinosus is predomi-
nantly tendinous at this location. Thus, sampling the 
medial hamstrings distally in the thigh samples the SM.
Semitendinosus (ST) (Figure 13–47A,B)
Innervation:
Sciatic nerve (tibial division), lumbosacral plexus, 
L4–L5–S1
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle into the posterior thigh at the mid-
point between the medial knee and ischial tuberosity
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the knee
Key Clinical Points:
• May be abnormal in sciatic nerve lesions, lumbosacral 
plexopathy, or L5 radiculopathy. In general the medial 
hamstrings are predominantly L5 whereas the lateral 
hamstrings are S1.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• If the needle is too anterior, it will be in the long 
head of the biceps femoris.
• If the needle is too posterior, it will be in the SM. 
However, the SM and ST have the same nerve 
(sciatic) and myotomal (L4–L5–S1) innervation.

OBTURATOR NERVE
Thigh Adductors (Gracilis, Adductor 
Longus, Adductor Magnus)  
(Figure 13–48A,B)
Innervation:
Obturator nerve, lumbar plexus, L2– L3–L4
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle into the medial thigh, three to four 
ﬁngerbreadths distal to the pubis
Activation:
Have the patient adduct the thigh
Key Clinical Points:
• The thigh adductor muscles can be thought of as a 
functional unit that includes the adductor longus and 
brevis, gracilis and adductor magnus. In most indi -
viduals, adipose over the medial thigh makes anatomic 
differentiation difﬁcult to impossible among these 
muscles. However, as they are all supplied by the 
same nerve (obturator) and same myotomes (L2– L3–
L4), it is not critical to sample one speciﬁc muscle as 
opposed to another. The very lateral part of the 
adductor magnus is supplied by the sciatic nerve; 
however, as this part of the muscle is so deep, 
sampling it by mistake is not an issue.
• Useful to help differentiate lesions of the lumbar 
plexus or lumbar roots from femoral neuropathy.
• Often requires longer length needle to sample (37 or 
50 mm).
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• As long as this muscle is sampled from the medial 
approach, there are no other nearby vascular struc -
tures or major nerves.
FEMORAL NERVE
Vastus Lateralis (VL) (Figure 13–49A,B)
Innervation:
Femoral nerve, lumbar plexus, L2–L3–L4
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle into the lateral thigh four to ﬁve 
ﬁngerbreadths proximal to the lateral knee
Activation:
Have the patient extend the knee while lifting the heel 
from the bed
Key Clinical Points:
• Often abnormal in lesions of the femoral nerve, 
lumbar plexus, or lumbar roots.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• As long as this muscle is sampled from the lateral 
approach, there are no other nearby vascular struc -
tures or major nerves.
• If the needle is too deep, it will be in the vastus 
intermedialis. However, this muscle is supplied by the 
same nerve (femoral) and same myotomes (L2– L3–
L4) as the VL.

Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle into the medial thigh three to four 
ﬁngerbreadths proximal to the medial knee
Activation:
Have the patient extend the knee while lifting the heel

Key Clinical Points:
• Often abnormal in lesions of the femoral nerve, 
lumbar plexus, or lumbar roots.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• As long as this muscle is sampled from the medial

tures or major nerves.
Rectus Femoris (RF) (Figure 13–51A,B)
Innervation:
Femoral nerve, lumbar plexus, L2–L3–L4
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle into the anterior thigh, at the mid-point 
between the hip and knee
Activation:
Have the patient extend the knee while lifting the heel 
from bed
Key Clinical Points:
• The RF is more difﬁcult to activate than the VM or 
the VL.
• The RF is more of a hip ﬂexor than a knee extensor.
• Often abnormal in lesions of the femoral nerve, 
lumbar plexus, or lumbar roots.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• As long as this muscle is sampled from the anterior 
approach, there are no other nearby vascular struc -
tures or major nerves.
• If the needle is too deep, it will be in the vastus 
intermedialis.
Iliacus (Figure 13–52A,B)
Innervation:
Femoral nerve, lumbar plexus, L2–L3–L4
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle two to three ﬁngerbreadths lateral to 
the femoral pulse below the inguinal ligament
Activation:
Have the patient ﬂex the hip
Key Clinical Points:
• The iliacus and psoas form a functional unit that 
ﬂexes the hip (the iliopsoas). However, at this site, 
only the iliacus is actually sampled.
• The iliacus is spared in entrapment of the femoral 
nerve at the inguinal ligament.
• This muscle is a useful proximal muscle to sample for 
myopathy and high lumbar radiculopathy.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: if the needle is too medial, the femoral 
nerve, artery and vein are vulnerable.
• If the needle is too superﬁcial and slightly lateral, it 
may be in the Sartorius.
• Caution: the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is just 
lateral to the insertion point.

INFERIOR GLUTEAL NERVE
Gluteus Maximus (GMAX) 
(Figure 13–55A,B,C)
Innervation:
Inferior gluteal nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L5– S1–S2
Needle Insertion:
Option 1: With the patient on their side, insert the 
needle into the upper outer quadrant of the buttock.
Option 2: With the patient on their side, insert the 
needle into the lower inner quadrant of the buttock
Activation:
Have the patient extend the thigh with the knee straight 
(for option 1), or have the patient squeeze the buttocks 
together (for option 2)
Key Clinical Points:
• The GMAX is the best proximal S1-innervated 
muscle for assessing S1 radiculopathy.
• Often used to differentiate lesions of the lumbosacral 
plexus or L5–S1 roots from sciatic nerve lesions.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: If the needle is in the center of the buttock 
or in the lower outer quadrant, and too deep, the 
sciatic nerve is within reach.
SUPERIOR GLUTEAL NERVE
Gluteus Medius (GMED) (Figure 13–53A,B)
Innervation:
Superior gluteal nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L4– L5–S1
Needle Insertion:
With the patient lying on his or her side and the side to 
be studied placed upward, insert the needle into the 
lateral thigh two to three ﬁngerbreadths distal to the 
iliac crest
Activation:
Have the patient abduct the thigh
Key Clinical Points:
• The GMED is a proximal predominantly 
L5-innervated muscle.
• Often used to differentiate lesions of the lumbosacral 
plexus or L5–S1 roots from sciatic nerve lesions.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• As long as this muscle is sampled from the lateral 
approach, there are no other nearby vascular struc -
tures or major nerves.
Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL)  
(Figure 13–54A,B)
Innervation:
Superior gluteal nerve, lumbosacral plexus, L4– L5–S1
Needle Insertion:
With the patient lying on his or her side and the side to 
be studied placed upward, insert the needle anterior to 
the greater trochanter below the anterior superior iliac 
crest
Activation:
Have the patient internally rotate the thigh (knees 
together, lift ipsilateral ankle toward ceiling)
Key Clinical Points:
• The TFL is a proximal predominantly L5-innervated 
muscle.
• Often used to differentiate lesions of the lumbosacral 
plexus or L5–S1 roots from sciatic nerve lesions.
• Although the TFL is also a hip abductor, its primary 
action is hip internal rotation.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• The muscle is very superﬁcial.
• If the needle is too deep, it may be in the vastus 
lateralis or intermedialis.
• The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is medial to the 
insertion site.

DORSAL RAMI
Paraspinal Muscles (PSP)  
(Figures 13–56A,B, 13–57A,B, 13–58A,B )
Innervation:
Dorsal rami, spinal nerves, nerve roots
Needle Insertion:
With the patient lying on his or her side and the side to 
be studied placed upward, insert the needle two 
ﬁngerbreadths from the midline spine with the needle 
directed slightly medially. T o ensure that the needle is 
in the deeper layer of muscles, it should be advanced 
to just touch the lamina and then pulled back slightly
Activation:
Cervical: Have the patient extend the neck
Thoracic: Have the patient extend the back or take a 
deep breath
Lumbosacral: Have the patient extend the hip with the 
leg straight
Key Clinical Points:
• The paraspinal muscles are the most proximal 
muscles.
• Paraspinal muscles are useful to sample for radicu -
lopathy and myopathy.
• In suspected neuropathic lesions, abnormalities in the 
paraspinal muscles only localize the lesion at or 
proximal to the root level. In radiculopathies, the 
speciﬁc root level is best determined by the limb 
muscles because of the wide overlap of adjacent 
myotomes, especially in the superﬁcial layers.
• The paraspinal muscles often are difﬁcult to relax. T o 
best assess insertional/spontaneous activity, the patient 
should assume a fetal position, with the neck, hips, 
and knees ﬂexed.
• These muscles often are difﬁcult to activate.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: rare cases of pneumothorax have been 
reported with improper needle placement too laterally 
in the lower cervical and especially in the thoracic 
paraspinal muscles.
• In the lower cervical paraspinals, if the needle is too 
superﬁcial, it may be in the upper trapezius.
• In the upper thoracic paraspinals, if the needle is too 
superﬁcial, it may be in the trapezius or rhomboids.
• In the lower thoracic paraspinals, if the needle is too 
superﬁcial, it may be in the trapezius or latissimus 
dorsi.

213Chapter 13 • Anatomy for Needle Electromyography
Key Clinical Points:
• The masseter is easy to activate.
• The masseter is useful to sample in patients with 
suspected motor neuron disease.
• Motor unit action potential duration normally is 
briefer in craniobulbar muscles, including the mas -
seter, compared with the limb muscles.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• Caution: the needle should be placed anteriorly in the 
muscle to avoid the parotid gland.
• Caution: the needle should not be placed too cepha -
lad to avoid the main parotid duct.
Frontalis (Figure 13–61A,B)
Innervation:
Frontal branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), 
medullary–pontine junction
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle tangentially one to two ﬁngerbreadths 
above the middle of the eyebrow
Activation:
Have the patient look up (raise the eyebrows)
Key Clinical Points:
• The muscle often is used for single-ﬁber EMG.
• The frontalis is useful for assessing Bell’s palsy.
• The frontalis is useful to sample in patients with 
suspected motor neuron disease.
• Motor unit action potential duration normally is 
briefer in craniobulbar muscles, including the facial 
muscles, compared with the limb muscles.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points:
• The frontalis is very thin; the needle must be inserted 
tangentially.
CRANIOBULBAR MUSCLES
Genioglossus (Tongue) (Figure 13–59A,B,C)
Innervation:
Hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII), medulla
Needle Insertion:
Option 1: The tongue can be sampled intraorally. The 
tongue is protruded and the examiner holds the end of 
the tongue with a gauze pad, and the needle is inserted 
laterally into the undersurface of the tongue ( Figure 
13–55A)
Option 2: The tongue can also be sampled 
percutaneously. The needle is inserted cephalad from 
beneath the anterior mandible, just lateral to the 
midline (Figure 13–55B and C)
Activation:
Have the patient stick out the tongue
Key Clinical Points:
• The tongue is difﬁcult to relax; thus, assessment of 
spontaneous activity often is difﬁcult.
• The tongue is very useful to sample in patients with 
suspected motor neuron disease.
• Motor unit action potential duration normally is 
briefer in craniobulbar muscles, including the tongue, 
compared with the limb muscles.
Cross-section Anatomy Key Points (Option 2):
• Insert the needle just off the midline; further lateral 
on both sides are the submental arteries which run 
under the chin and are major branches of the facial 
arteries.
• If the needle is too superﬁcial, it will be in the 
geniohyoideus, supplied by the C1 nerve root.
Masseter (Figure 13–60A,B,C)
Innervation:
Mandibular nerve, trigeminal motor branch (V3), pons
Needle Insertion:
Insert the needle two ﬁngerbreadths anterior to the angle 
of the jaw and one to two ﬁngerbreadths cephalad, 
palpating the muscle as the patient clenches the jaw. 
Insert the needle on a line between the upper and 
lower teeth
Activation:
Have the patient clench the jaw
